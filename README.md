# node-embeddings-with-a-traditional-community-detection-method
The goal of this use case is to demonstrate how node embeddings from graph convolutional neural networks trained in unsupervised manner are comparable to standard community detection methods based on graph partitioning. Here, we demonstrate, using the terrorist group dataset, that the infomap communities and the graphSAGE embedding clusters (GSEC) provide qualitatively different insights into underlying data patterns.
